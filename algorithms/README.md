# TT/Algorithms

## Preface

In the modern era of programming with your fancy API calls, LLMs,
GeeksForGeeks blog posts, and Web Development plebians developing a 
new and improved framework dumbing every programmer out there. Knowing
how to implement algorithms and data structures from scratch is the
only thing that can distinguish you from idiots.

You must have some idea on why an algorithm `X` works that way and why
it is better (or worse) than another algorithm `Y`. You must also know
why `X` is correct and what it means for `X` to be correct.

---

Contains implementations of algorithms. Each algorithm is marked with
one of the two symbols:

| Symbol | Description            |
| -----  | -----                  |
| [S]    | Sequential Algorithm   |
| [P]    | Parallel Algorithm     |

Furthermore, algorithms are marked with an additional symbol depending
on their (unofficial) classification, based on the type of problem 
they solve or the data structure they use:

| Symbol | Description                                               |
| -----  | -----                                                     |
| [Grp]  | Graph (Graph and all subtypes, e.g., trees, DAGs, etc.)   |
| [Seq]  | Sequences (Arrays/Lists)                                  |
| [Set]  | Sets (Sets or Multisets)                                  |
| [Geo]  | Geometric (Geometric problems)                            |
| [Num]  | Numeric (Numeric problems, $R^n$)                         |
| [Cry]  | Cryptography (Cryptographic algorithms)                   |
