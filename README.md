# Turing Tome `TT`

Turing Tome is my big bag of solutions to competitive programming 
problems and algorithmic practice problems, implementations of 
algorithms and data structures, among other things.

## Moving Around the TT

This used to be my competitive programming working environment. Hence,
some files like `run.ps1`, `sol.psq`, and `clr.ps1` are some scripts I
left here from the past.

I do still use them since I use them on occasion, so feel free to 
ignore them.

This repository has three main sections:

1. [`algorithms`](https://github.com/zrygan/TuringTome/algorithms)
contains implementations of algorithms.
2. [`data structures`](https://github.com/zrygan/TuringTome/data structures)
contains implementations of data structures.
3. [`solutions`](https://github.com/zrygan/TuringTome/solutions)
contains solutions to competitive programming and algorithmic problems.

Each section has its own read me. So if you need more information, go 
there not here!
