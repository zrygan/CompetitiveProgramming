# zrygan/Competitive Programming

Competitive Programming workspace and repository of solutions and my personal environment for competitive programming.

Don't expect these are the best solutions üêµ.

Also don't expect these to contain **readable** code! I may post a blog on my personal website on how the design of a solution... so check that or something.

I primarily code in C, C++, or Java. Occasionally, Python if we can abuse Python to solve the problem (or my hands are tired).

This is not a repository of solutions. **Don't you dare make a pull request or issue recommending changes or a solution to a problem**.
