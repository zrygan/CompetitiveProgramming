# TT/Solutions

&emsp;&emsp;Don't expect these are the best solutions 🐵.

Also don't expect these to contain **readable** code! I may post a 
blog on my personal website on solutions design (so check that or 
something, if it exists).

I primarily code in C, C++, or Java. Occasionally, Python if we can 
abuse Python to solve the problem (or my hands are tired).

> Currently, I am in love with Go (written on August 2025).

This is not a repository of *all* solutions or *known* solutions. 
**Don't you dare make a pull request or issue recommending changes 
or a solution to a problem**. These are *my* solutions! So don't get 
your monkey hands and try to improve upon them.

These solutions usually are just **facelift-ed** versions of your 
usual algorithms.
